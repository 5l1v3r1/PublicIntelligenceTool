This is a Project I have been working on I call it PITT or Public Intelligence Tool, 

It is based on The Iron Web browser, and I have loaded with tons of links and extension 
for doing Open Source Intelligence Gathering. I Did not write the Browser it is a 
open source version of Google Chrome developed by SRWare located here
https://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php

I know and understand there are many other tools online like this one online, 
but I have found they are not updated much and can take a long time to update by only one person.
My Idea for this tool is that it can will updated regularly and by everyday users. 
I hope that from everyones use and in put we can together make this a powerfull and usefull tool.

it is currently being beta tested by friends and I dont want to upload it unless i know it works 

Hope to be able to Update it and everyone else soon

UPDATE 1: It has come to my atention that a Virus Tottal Scan has come back with 2 flags both where for trojans that are not in this tool, I have researched this issue and found that it is got todo with the browser estenshions I Have installed that are used for WebPage modification. 

UPDATE 1.5: Browser is now 100% portable, so it can be put on a usb drive and carried with you where ever it is needed, No need to install any files or programs
