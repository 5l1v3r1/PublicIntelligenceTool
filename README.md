# PublicIntelligenceTool
This is a Project I have been working on I call it PITT or Public Intelligence Tool, 
It is the Iron Web browser loaded with tons of links and extension for doing Open Source Intelligence Gathering.
I Did not write the Browser it is a open source version of Google Chrome developed 
by  SRWare located here https://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php  ,
I know and understand there are many other tools online like this one, 
but i have found they are not updated much and can take a long time to update by only one person.
My Idea for this tool is that it can will updated regularly and by everyday users. 
I hope to be releasing this tool to everyone soon, 

it is currently being beta tested by friends and I dont want to upload it unless i know it works 

Hope to be able to Update it and everyone else soon
